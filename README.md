# ðŸ’¾ Borderlands4SaveDataResigner - What is it :interrobang:
<img src="https://github.com/mi5hmash/Borderlands4SaveDataResigner/blob/main/.resources/images/Borderlands4SaveDataResignerLogo.png" alt="icon" width="256"/>

This command-line utility can **encrypt and decrypt SaveData files** from the Borderlands 4 game. It can also **resign SaveData files** with your own UserID so you can **load them on your User Account**.

## Supported platforms
It only supports PC SaveData files from the Steam and Epic Games Store (EGS).

# ðŸ¤¯ Why was it created :interrobang:
I wanted to share a SaveData file with a friend, but it isn't possible by default.

# :scream: Is it safe?
The short answer is: **No.** 
> [!CAUTION]
> If you unreasonably edit your SaveData files, you risk corrupting them or getting banned from playing online. In both cases, you will lose your progress.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Always create a backup of any files before editing them.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Disable the Steam Cloud before you replace any SaveData files.

Youâ€™ve been warned. Now that you fully understand the possible consequences, you may proceed to the next chapter.

# :scroll: How to use this tool
This utility processes files based on the selected mode (`-m`). Each mode requires a an input file path (`-p`). Mode-specific required parameters must be provided accordingly. Additional optional parameters may also be included.

> [!NOTE]
> All processed files are saved in a newly created folder within the **`_OUTPUT`** directory, located in the program's root directory.

> [!NOTE]
> Log files are saved in CSV format in the program's root directory. Only the two most recent log files are retained.

> [!TIP]
You can use the SteamDB calculator at [steamdb.info](https://steamdb.info/calculator/) to find your 64-bit SteamID.
